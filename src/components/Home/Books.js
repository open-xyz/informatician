                blond-haired, blue-eyed goddess Daphne Parrish takes for

                plan may fall to pieces. With shocking turns and dark
                secrets that will keep you guessing until the very end,

                  The body On an island off the coast of Ireland, guests
                  gather to celebrate two people joining their lives
                  together as one. The groom: handsome and charming, a
                  rising television star. The bride: smart and ambitious,
                  a magazine publisher. It's a wedding for a magazine, or
                  for a celebrity: the designer dress, the remote
                  location, the luxe party favors, the boutique whiskey.
                  The cell phone service may be spotty and the waves may
                  be rough, but every detail has been expertly planned and
                  will be expertly executed. But perfection is for plans,
                  and people are all too human. As the champagne is popped
                  and the festivities begin, resentments and petty
                  jealousies begin to mingle with the reminiscences and
                  well wishes. The groomsmen begin the drinking game from
                  their school days. The bridesmaid not-so-accidentally
                  ruins her dress. The bride's oldest (male) friend gives
                  an uncomfortably caring toast. And then someone turns up
                  dead. Who didn't wish the happy couple well? And perhaps
                  more important, why?`,

                  crowd, and as threats in Facebook posts escalated into
                  real-world attacks on the Capitol. Days later, in a

                  economies are collapsing, and everyone is perpetually
                  offended on Twitter. At this moment in history, when we
                  have access to technology, education and communication
                  our ancestors couldn't even dream of, so many of us come

                  malaise and help fix it, it's Mark Manson. In 2016,
                  Manson published The Subtle Art of Not Giving A F*ck, a
                  book that brilliantly gave shape to the ever-present,
                  low-level hum of anxiety that permeates modern living.
                  He showed us that technology had made it too easy to
                  care about the wrong things, that our culture had
                  convinced us that the world owed us something when it
                  didn't—and worst of all, that our modern and maddening
                  urge to always find happiness only served to make us
                  unhappier. Instead, the “subtle art” of that title
                  turned out to be a bold challenge: to choose your
                  struggle; to narrow and focus and find the pain you want
                  to sustain. The result was a book that became an
                  international phenomenon, selling millions of copies
                  worldwide while becoming the #1 bestseller in 13
                  different countries.`,

    aboutBook: `<em>New York Times </em>
                bestselling author and journalist Anderson Cooper
                teams with New York Times bestselling historian and
                novelist Katherine Howe to chronicle the rise and fall
                of a legendary American dynasty—his mother's family,
                the Vanderbilts.`,
    bookSynapsis: `One of the Washington Post's Notable Works of Nonfiction
                  of 2021When eleven-year-old Cornelius Vanderbilt began
                  to work on his father's small boat ferrying supplies in
                  New York Harbor at the beginning of the nineteenth
                  century, no one could have imagined that one day he
                  would, through ruthlessness, cunning, and a pathological
                  desire for money, build two empires—one in shipping and
                  another in railroads—that would make him the richest man
                  in America. His staggering fortune was fought over by
                  his heirs after his death in 1877, sowing familial
                  discord that would never fully heal. Though his son
                  Billy doubled the money left by “the Commodore,”
                  subsequent generations competed to find new and ever
                  more extraordinary ways of spending it. By 2018, when
                  the last Vanderbilt was forced out of The Breakers—the
                  seventy-room summer estate in Newport, Rhode Island,
                  that Cornelius's grandson and namesake had built—the
                  family would have been unrecognizable to the tycoon who
                  started it all.Now, the Commodore's
                  great-great-great-grandson Anderson Cooper, joins with
                  historian Katherine Howe to explore the story of his
                  legendary family and their outsized influence. Cooper
                  and Howe breathe life into the ancestors who built the
                  family's empire, basked in the Commodore's wealth,
                  hosted lavish galas, and became synonymous with
                  unfettered American capitalism and high society.`,

      A recurring dream troubles Santiago, a young and adventurous 
      Andalusian shepherd. He has the dream every time he sleeps under 
      a sycamore tree that grows out of the ruins of a church. During 
      the dream, a child tells him to seek treasure at the foot of the 
      Egyptian pyramids. Santiago consults a gypsy woman to interpret 
      the dream, and to his surprise she tells him to go to Egypt. A 
      strange, magical old man named Melchizedek, who claims to be the 
      King of Salem, echoes the gypsy's advice and tells Santiago that 
      it is his Personal Legend to journey to the pyramids. Melchizedek 
      convinces Santiago to sell his flock and set off to Tangier. When 
      Santiago arrives in Tangier, a thief robs him, forcing him to find 
      work with a local crystal merchant. The conservative and kindly 
      merchant teaches Santiago several lessons, and Santiago encourages 
      the merchant to take risks with his business. The risks pay off, 
      and Santiago becomes a rich man in just a year.
