                            AdChoices works by providing a symbol, typically represented as a small blue triangle, on or near the ads that are delivered based on your browsing behavior. By clicking on the AdChoices icon, you can access information about the data collection and use practices associated with that particular ad, as well as exercise control over personalized advertising.
